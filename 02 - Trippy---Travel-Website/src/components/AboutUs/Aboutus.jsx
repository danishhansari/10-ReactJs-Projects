      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Trippy is owned and managed by Trippy.in Pvt. Ltd., a leading brand in
        web designing services and e-commerce solutions. Trippy .in Angela
        earned a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering and worked for a
        research facility for five and a half years before she decided that she
        wanted to travel full-time. Angela is always looking for activities to
        keep her busy. Because of her love for all things food-related, she can
        be often found spending her free time searching for and experimenting
        with new recipes, trying out new Thai food from local markets, and
        finding new restaurants and cafés. Now in her early 30’s and at the five
        and a half year mark in Thailand, she is still pursuing her goal of
        learning to speak and read Thai. She’s always thinking of new topics to
        write about to help travelers and expats overcome hurdles so often
        experienced when traveling around and living in Thailand.
